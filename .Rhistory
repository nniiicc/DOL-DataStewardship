**Data as a Relational Concept**
Successfully working with and offering services around data is often as much about domain knowledge (e.g. what do stakeholders of DOL know as experts) as it is about having a precise or clear language for describing data.
To begin the curriculum, we will develop some working definitions of basic concepts - like data, and data stewardship. Having clarity on these basic concepts will allow us to not only communicate with others more effectively, but it will also allow us to quickly move from the basics to more advanced topics in this curriculum.
## Defining Data
The Department of Licensing defines data as “Numbers and facts that have not been grouped or analyzed. (Data that is grouped becomes statistics. Data that is analyzed becomes data analysis.) This includes numbers and facts in electronic records, paper records, emails, text messages, recordings, and images.”  (Policy Admin 1.7.7)
